This repository consists of all the programs I write as I try to learn OpenGL 4.0. I give a short description of what each program does in this readme.

makefile
--------
The makefile is currently set only to compile first_glut.cpp and to do cleanup.

first_glut
----------
Contains a glut based program that demonstrates three different ways of drawing a plain white square.
Methods:
1. Fixed Function Pipeline stuff.
2. Vertex Arrays
3. Vertex Buffer Objects, Vertex Array Objects and shaders.
